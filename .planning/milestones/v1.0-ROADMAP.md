## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Brand name: Nuage | French for "cloud" - elegant, evokes smoke abstractly |
| Prices in cents | Avoids floating-point precision issues |
| File-based JSON storage | Simple MVP, no database setup needed |
| Server Actions for CRUD | Next.js 15 pattern, no API routes |
| Free shipping for MVP | Simplify launch, add later |
| Static generation for products | Better performance and SEO |

**Issues Resolved:**

- None - clean execution

**Issues Deferred:**

- Payment integration (Stripe France)
- Real supplier data import
- Legal pages (Mentions legales, CGV)
- Email notifications

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Placeholder legal links in footer
- No authentication on admin panel
