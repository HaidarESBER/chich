**Why client-side tracking:**
- No database writes needed (keeps infrastructure simple)
- Works for anonymous visitors (no auth required)
- Fast (no API calls)
- Privacy-friendly (stays in browser)
- Persists across sessions

**Why this approach:**
- localStorage for persistence (survives page reloads)
- Timestamp for potential "viewed within X days" filtering later
- MAX 6 items to prevent bloat
- Recent items first (array prepend)
- Excludes current product from "recently viewed" display

  <name>Task 2: Create RecentlyViewed component and trending badge</name>
  <files>src/components/product/RecentlyViewed.tsx, src/components/product/TrendingBadge.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Create RecentlyViewed component** `src/components/product/RecentlyViewed.tsx`:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Product } from "@/types/product";
import { getRecentlyViewedIds } from "@/lib/social-proof";
import { ProductCard } from "./ProductCard";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

interface RecentlyViewedProps {
  allProducts: Product[];
  currentProductId?: string;
}

export function RecentlyViewed({ allProducts, currentProductId }: RecentlyViewedProps) {
  const [recentlyViewedProducts, setRecentlyViewedProducts] = useState<Product[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Get recently viewed IDs (excluding current product)
    const ids = getRecentlyViewedIds(currentProductId);

    // Find products by IDs, maintaining order
    const products = ids
      .map((id) => allProducts.find((p) => p.id === id))
      .filter((p): p is Product => p !== undefined);

    setRecentlyViewedProducts(products);
  }, [allProducts, currentProductId]);

  if (recentlyViewedProducts.length === 0) {
    return null; // Don't show section if no recent products
  }

  return (
    <section className="py-8 bg-background-secondary">
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">
          Récemment consultés
        </h2>

        {/* Horizontal scrollable grid */}
        <div className="overflow-x-auto pb-4 -mx-4 px-4">
          <div className="flex gap-4 min-w-max">
            {recentlyViewedProducts.map((product, index) => (
              <motion.div
                key={product.id}
                initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }}
                animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
                transition={{ delay: index * 0.05 }}
                className="w-64 flex-shrink-0"
              >
                <ProductCard product={product} priority={index < 2} />
              </motion.div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

**Create TrendingBadge component** `src/components/product/TrendingBadge.tsx`:

```typescript
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export function TrendingBadge() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
      className="absolute top-3 right-3 px-3 py-1 bg-accent text-primary text-xs font-bold rounded-full shadow-md z-10"
    >
      🔥 Tendance
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

**Why this design:**
- Client-side only (useEffect runs in browser, not SSR)
- Horizontal scroll for mobile-friendly browsing
- Stagger animation for visual polish
- Empty state handling (hide if no recent products)
- TrendingBadge is simple overlay badge for product cards
- Uses existing ProductCard component (consistent styling)
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, components render correctly</verify>
  <done>RecentlyViewed component displays horizontal product carousel, TrendingBadge shows fire emoji with "Tendance" label</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Integrate social proof into product pages</name>
  <files>src/app/produits/[slug]/ProductDetailClient.tsx, src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Update ProductDetailClient** to track views and show recently viewed:

Add imports:
```typescript
import { useEffect } from "react"; // If not already imported
import { addToRecentlyViewed } from "@/lib/social-proof";
import { RecentlyViewed } from "@/components/product/RecentlyViewed";
```

Add tracking effect (inside component, after other useEffect):
```typescript
// Track product view
useEffect(() => {
  addToRecentlyViewed(product);
}, [product]);
```

Add RecentlyViewed section at bottom of component (before closing `</main>` tag):
```typescript
{/* Recently viewed products */}
<RecentlyViewed
  allProducts={allProducts}
  currentProductId={product.id}
/>
```

**Update ProductCard** to show trending badge:

Add imports:
```typescript
import { isTrending } from "@/lib/social-proof";
import { TrendingBadge } from "./TrendingBadge";
```

Add trending badge inside product card (at top, before product image):
```typescript
{/* Trending badge */}
{isTrending(product) && <TrendingBadge />}
```

Make sure ProductCard has `position: relative` for absolute positioning of badge:
```typescript
<div className="relative bg-background rounded-[--radius-card] overflow-hidden shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
  {isTrending(product) && <TrendingBadge />}
  {/* rest of card content */}
</div>
```

**Why this integration:**
- Product views tracked automatically on page load
- Recently viewed shown below product details (cross-sell opportunity)
- Trending badges on featured products (social proof)
- Non-intrusive placement (doesn't block main content)
  </action>
  <verify>Visit product pages, recently viewed section appears after viewing multiple products. Trending badges show on featured products.</verify>
  <done>Social proof integrated: product views tracked, recently viewed carousel displays, trending badges visible on featured products</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] npm run build succeeds
- [ ] Viewing product adds it to recently viewed (check localStorage)
- [ ] Recently viewed section shows up to 6 products
- [ ] Current product excluded from recently viewed
- [ ] Trending badges display on featured products
- [ ] Horizontal scroll works on mobile
- [ ] No console errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- Recently viewed tracking works client-side
- RecentlyViewed component displays horizontal carousel
- Trending badges show on featured products
- Product views persist across sessions (localStorage)
- Social proof elements enhance user engagement
- No performance impact (client-side only)
