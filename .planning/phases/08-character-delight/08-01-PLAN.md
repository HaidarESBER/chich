<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add celebratory animation to AddToCartButton success state</name>
  <files>src/components/product/AddToCartButton.tsx</files>
  <action>
When item is added to cart (isAdded state), animate the button with:
- Scale pulse effect: scale from 1 → 1.05 → 1 over 0.4s with spring animation
- Success checkmark icon that fades in and slides up slightly (y: 5 → 0) next to button text
- Button text changes to "Ajouté au panier !" with subtle green accent color shift
- After 2s, smoothly crossfade back to original state

Use Framer Motion for animations. Keep it subtle and premium - avoid garish effects. The celebration should feel satisfying but not disruptive.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, add item to cart and verify success animation plays smoothly</verify>
  <done>Button pulses with spring animation, checkmark appears, text changes color, all transitions smooth</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add confetti celebration to order confirmation page</name>
  <files>src/components/order/OrderConfirmation.tsx</files>
  <action>
Install canvas-confetti library (npm install canvas-confetti @types/canvas-confetti).

On OrderConfirmation mount, trigger a subtle confetti burst:
- Fire from center top, falling downward
- Use brand colors: charcoal (#2C2C2C) and blush (#D4A5A5) particles
- Particle count: 50-60 (not overwhelming)
- Duration: 2 seconds
- Gravity: 0.8 for graceful fall

Wrap confetti trigger in useEffect with empty dependency array. Use motion.div to animate the success checkmark icon entrance: scale from 0.8 → 1 with spring animation, synchronized with confetti burst.

Keep confetti tasteful and premium - single burst, not continuous. Brand should feel celebratory but sophisticated.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, navigate to order confirmation and verify confetti fires once with brand colors</verify>
  <done>Confetti bursts on mount with brand colors, checkmark animates in with spring, effect feels premium and celebratory</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add creative loading state to checkout form submission</name>
  <files>src/components/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the current isSubmitting loading state with an animated loading indicator:

- When isSubmitting=true, button shows "Traitement en cours..." with animated ellipsis (three dots that pulse in sequence: opacity 0.3 → 1 with 0.4s stagger)
- Add a subtle rotating spinner icon (cloud/smoke icon to match "Nuage" brand) next to text
- Use Framer Motion animate prop with rotate: 360, transition: {duration: 1.5, repeat: Infinity, ease: "linear"}
- Button remains at original size (no jarring layout shift)

For the spinner, use a simple SVG circle/cloud shape. Keep rotation smooth and slow (1.5s per rotation) for premium feel, not frantic.

If there's a submitError, animate the error message entrance with slide down from y: -10 → 0 and fade in (opacity 0 → 1) over 0.3s. Use red accent color but keep it subtle.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, submit checkout form and verify loading animation with rotating icon and pulsing dots</verify>
  <done>Loading state shows rotating cloud icon with pulsing ellipsis, error messages slide in smoothly, no layout shifts</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Add subtle hover micro-interactions to Footer links</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/Footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance footer links with Framer Motion hover effects:

- Wrap each link in motion.a with whileHover prop
- On hover: slightly increase brightness (filter: brightness(1.1)) and add subtle translate up (y: -1px)
- Transition duration: 0.2s with easeOut
- Brand name ("Nuage") heading gets a subtle scale effect on hover: scale(1.02)

Convert footer navigation Links to use motion.a wrapper. Keep effects extremely subtle - footer should feel polished, not distracting.

Also add a subtle fade-in animation to the entire footer on initial render using viewport intersection (once: true), consistent with other scroll animations from Phase 5.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, scroll to footer and verify links have subtle hover feedback and footer fades in on scroll</verify>
  <done>Footer links brighten and lift slightly on hover, brand scales subtly, footer fades in on scroll, all effects feel premium</done>
</task>

  <what-built>Character and delight enhancements across success states, loading feedback, and footer interactions</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Test Add to Cart:
       - Visit http://localhost:3000/produits/[any-product-slug]
       - Click "Ajouter au panier" and verify button pulses with checkmark animation
       - Confirm transition back to normal state after 2s
    3. Test Order Confirmation:
       - Complete a full checkout flow to reach confirmation page
       - Verify confetti bursts once with brand colors (charcoal/blush)
       - Confirm checkmark icon animates in with spring effect
    4. Test Checkout Loading:
       - Go to checkout page with items in cart
       - Submit form and verify rotating cloud icon with pulsing ellipsis
       - Check that layout doesn't shift during loading state
    5. Test Footer Interactions:
       - Scroll to footer and verify fade-in animation
       - Hover over navigation links and confirm subtle lift/brighten effect
       - Hover over "Nuage" brand name and verify scale effect
    6. Overall feel:
       - Animations should feel celebratory but sophisticated
       - No garish or overwhelming effects
       - Premium brand character maintained throughout
