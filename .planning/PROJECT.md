# Chicha E-Commerce

## What This Is

A premium e-commerce dropshipping store for hookah and chicha accessories, targeting the French market with European expansion in mind. Single brand store with a curated selection of quality products, presented with a modern minimalist aesthetic that builds instant trust.

## Core Value

The brand looks so premium and legitimate that visitors trust it instantly — visual identity drives conversion.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Modern minimalist visual identity (clean, sophisticated, editorial — no "AI look")
- [ ] Product catalog for hookah accessories (hookahs, bowls, hoses, charcoal, accessories — no tobacco)
- [ ] Curated product selection with quality-focused presentation
- [ ] Dropshipping integration with supplier(s)
- [ ] Shopping cart and checkout flow
- [ ] Payment processing (French market)
- [ ] Order management and fulfillment tracking
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] French language content
- [ ] Brand identity development (name, logo, visual system)

### Out of Scope

- Multi-language support — v1 is French only, expansion later
- Loyalty/rewards program — adds complexity, not needed for first sale
- Tobacco products — regulatory complexity, focus on accessories
- Blog/content marketing — can add post-launch
- Multi-vendor marketplace — single brand store model

## Context

**Market:** France has a significant chicha culture. The hookah accessories market in Europe is growing, with Germany being the largest market. Starting in France provides a strong home base before expansion.

**Competition:** Many existing hookah shops look outdated or overly busy. The opportunity is to stand out with a clean, premium presentation that feels more like a lifestyle brand than a smoke shop.

**Dropshipping:** This model requires solid supplier relationships and careful product curation since you don't control inventory directly. Product research and selection will be critical to maintaining the premium feel.

**Visual direction:** Modern minimalist — think high-end lifestyle brand, not traditional smoke shop aesthetic. Clean typography, restrained color palette, quality product photography, editorial presentation.

## Constraints

- **Business model**: Dropshipping — no inventory management, dependent on supplier reliability
- **Regulatory**: No tobacco products — accessories only to avoid regulatory complexity
- **Market**: France-first launch — content and payments must work for French customers

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Single brand store (not marketplace) | Unified brand experience, simpler to build and manage | — Pending |
| Modern minimalist aesthetic | Differentiates from busy/outdated competitors, builds trust | — Pending |
| France-first launch | Home market, manageable scope, strong chicha culture | — Pending |
| No tobacco products | Regulatory simplicity, focus on accessories | — Pending |
| Brand name TBD | Will develop during project | — Pending |
